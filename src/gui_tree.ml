(* Backend-neutral GUI tree for Suchu.

   Everything here turns the parser's raw [gui_block] into a typed tree and
   reads style properties out of it. None of it knows how anything is drawn,
   which is the point: Gui_backend (Bogue) and Gui_backend_raylib both consume
   this module, so the language surface is defined in exactly one place.

   Extracted from gui_backend.ml when the raylib backend was started. *)

   representation (Bogue's Draw.align, raylib's own layout pass). *)
type align =

(* A handler is a callable value taking the widget it fired on and the value
   that came with it, rather than a block of statements.

   It used to be the block, which the backend then ran through the evaluator
   against the environment captured when the window was built. That works while
   the program is being interpreted and cannot work once it is compiled: a
   handler reads the program's variables, and in compiled code those are OCaml
   refs with no environment to look them up in. Holding a value instead lets each
   side build one its own way -- the evaluator closes over the environment, the
   compiler closes over the refs -- while everything from here down stays the
   same. *)
