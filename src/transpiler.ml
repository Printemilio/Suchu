(* Suchu to OCaml.

   The point is not escaping the interpreter for its own sake. It is that a
   Suchu variable currently costs a lookup by name through a chain of hash
   tables, and every expression costs a walk over AST nodes. Translated, a
   variable becomes an OCaml [ref] and an expression becomes OCaml code that
   ocamlopt turns into machine instructions.

   What does not change: Suchu is dynamically typed, so every value stays a
   [Runtime.value] and every operator stays a match on its constructors. That
   is the ceiling of this approach. It is also why the output calls the very
   same operator functions the evaluator calls -- [plus_operator] here is
   [plus_operator] there -- so the arithmetic cannot drift between the two.

   The output is meant to be read. Someone should be able to open the generated
   file, recognise their program, and follow it. *)

  raise (Unsupported (Printf.sprintf "the compiler does not handle %s yet" what))

(* --- names ----------------------------------------------------------------

   Suchu and OCaml agree on the shape of an identifier. They disagree on
   OCaml's reserved words, and on Suchu allowing a leading capital. Prefixing
   with 'v_' settles both at once, and 'v_total' still reads as 'total' to
   whoever opens the file -- which a hash or a counter would not. *)

let ocaml_name suchu_name = "v_" ^ suchu_name

(* --- scopes ---------------------------------------------------------------

   One frame per Suchu block. A name in some frame is bound; a name in none is a
   global -- a built-in like [print].

   Bound names come in two kinds. Almost all are [Ref]: an OCaml ref, which is
   the whole point of compiling. The exception is the top level of an imported
   module, which is a [Slot] in a real environment, because 'math_tools.pi' has
   to read the same binding the module's own functions read, and an environment
   holds values rather than refs so there is nothing to share. It costs a
   hashtable lookup for a module's own top-level names -- exactly what the
   evaluator costs -- and the function bodies around them are still compiled. *)

type binding =
  | Ref of string
  | Slot of string * string  (* the environment's OCaml name, and the Suchu name *)
  (* A native 'int ref'. Every value in Suchu is boxed, because the language is
     dynamically typed and any variable may hold anything. But a variable that is
     only ever given integers does not need the box, and the box is most of the
     cost: 'total = total + i' otherwise allocates a V_int for the result and
     goes through a match on constructors to get there.

     A variable qualifies when every assignment to it, anywhere in the block that
     owns it, is an expression provably of integer type. Reading it where a value
     is wanted costs one box; reading it inside integer arithmetic costs
     nothing. *)
  | IntRef of string
  (* The same for floats. Worth its own kind rather than folding into the above,
     because the two do not mix: '%' refuses floats, and '/' gives a float even
     when both sides are integers. *)
  | FloatRef of string
  (* A plain value, not a cell: a parameter the function never writes to. There
     is nothing to write through, so there is nothing to allocate. *)

   places must run once -- which is the evaluator's cache, expressed in OCaml.

   Suchu promises left to right, and a call in an operand is enough to make the
   difference visible.

   Saying so explicitly means binding each operand to a name in turn, which is
   correct but unpleasant to read, and the generated file is meant to be read.
   So it is only done where the order can be observed: with at most one operand
   that does anything, there is nothing to reorder. A literal and the reading of
   a variable do nothing. Everything else might -- print, raise, assign -- and
   an operator counts, since two operators that both raise would report
   whichever ran first. *)
(* --- which variables hold integers ----------------------------------------

   Deciding this wrongly does not make a program slow, it makes it wrong, so the
   rule is narrow and everything not understood is refused.

   A name introduced in a block is an integer when every assignment to it in that
   block, however deeply nested, is an expression of integer type -- and when
   nothing else in the block binds the same name, since a parameter, a 'for'
   variable or a 'try' error of that name would be a different variable the
   analysis is not tracking.

   Integer type means: an integer literal; a variable already known to hold
   integers; '+', '-', '*' or '%' of two of those; a negation of one. Not '/',
   which always gives a float, and not '**', which leaves the integers as soon as
   it overflows. *)
